## 📖 The Story

Most investment apps assume you already know two critical things:

• How much you can afford to invest  
• How to invest it safely  

But what if you're just starting out?  
What if you're a student managing monthly expenses, unsure whether you have $50 or $500 left after rent, groceries, and that weekend trip?

**Asset Universe** solves this by creating a complete financial journey in one platform:

**First**, figure out your financial reality.  
**Then**, learn how to invest what you have confidently and safely.

Built by **Yash Kunal Mehta**, a Computer Science & Finance student at Rutgers University, this app bridges the gap between budgeting and investing, turning financial confusion into financial clarity.

## 🚀 What Makes Asset Universe Different?

### 🎯 Budget First Philosophy

Unlike traditional investment platforms that jump straight to portfolios, Asset Universe starts with a simple question:

> *"How much money do I actually have left this month?"*

The integrated budget calculator tracks your income, expenses, and recurring transactions to show you in real time how much you can safely allocate to investments.

### 📚 Learn Before You Leap

Six comprehensive asset education modules teach you the fundamentals:

• 📈 **Stocks** — Equity ownership, growth potential, volatility  
• 🏛️ **Bonds** — Fixed income, stability, interest rates  
• 📊 **ETFs** — Diversification, low fees, passive investing  
• 💎 **Cryptocurrency** — Digital assets, blockchain, high risk reward  
• 🛢️ **Commodities** — Gold, oil, inflation hedging  
• 🏠 **Real Estate** — Property investment, REITs, tangible assets  

Each module breaks down risk, return expectations, liquidity, and real world use cases.

### 🎮 Real Market Simulation (No Shortcuts)

The simulator uses real time market data from **Finnhub**, **CoinGecko**, and **Alpha Vantage** APIs.

But here's the twist:

There is **no fast forward button**.

You cannot skip ahead to see if your portfolio grew. You have to wait, just like real investing. This forces users to experience actual market volatility, emotional discipline, and long term thinking.
